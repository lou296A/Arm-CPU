####  ARM-CPU
The ARM-CPU is implemented using an open-source software called Issie. Issie is an application for digital circuit design and simulation, which enable the development of digital circuit at logic gate level.  
the processing unit was developed as a university project for the 1st year Electronic and Electrical/Electronic and Information Engineering course at Imperial College London.

The objective of this project was to build an efficient CPU using the ARM architecture, optimized to solve commonly occurring computing problems. As the CPU was designed at logic gate level, the feature had to be chosen carefully to achieve the best performance in the greatest number of applications for the smallest number of transistors.


It needed the following capabilities:

The CPU should be working with 16-bit <br>
The ALU should support all the basic operations such as add, subtract and multiplication, shifting, XOR, AND, MOV<br>
support Floating point arithmetic using the 32-bit IEEE 754 single precision  <br>
The CPU should also support pipelining<br>
Serial communication using UART for network communication and storage.<br>
Dual-core to perform faster computation.<br>

These were successfully developed and can be seen within the repository.
